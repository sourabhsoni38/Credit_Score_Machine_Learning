# Credit_Score_Machine_Learning
Today banks and credit card companies use Machine Learning algorithms to classify all the customers in their database based on their credit history. It helps banks and credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

# Problem Statement:

Banks and credit card companies rely on accurate credit score assessments to evaluate the creditworthiness of their customers and make informed lending decisions. In today's digital era, these financial institutions harness the power of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to efficiently classify and assess customers based on their credit history. The need to leverage ML for credit score classification is paramount in ensuring timely and accurate credit evaluations.

To address this, our project aims to explore, implement, and demonstrate the use of Machine Learning techniques for credit score classification. I work with real-world credit data to build a predictive model that can effectively categorize customers into different credit score categories. 

## The primary objectives of this project include:

### Data Preparation: 
Collect and preprocess credit-related data, ensuring it is clean, complete, and suitable for ML analysis.
